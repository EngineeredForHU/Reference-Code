    * Four Pillars of OOP:
    * 1. Abstractions
    *   Examples:
    *  - Triangle
    *  - Table
    *
    * 2. Encapsulation
    *   Examples:
    *  - Driving a car: All you need to know how to: turn the car on, how to push the gas pedal, steer the car. You don't need to know how to fire a cylinder, or how the interal engine works.
    *
    * 3. Inheritance
    *   Example:
    *  - Allows objects to inherit from parent classes
    *
    * 4. Polymorphism
    *   Example:
    *  - Animal communicate in different ways
    *  - The "Method" communicate can take different forms
    *
    * Class - is how we structure our code in OOP
    * Class is like a blueprint
    * Object is the actual product developed from the blueprint
    * An object is an instance of a class
    *
